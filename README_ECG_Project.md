# Design and Implementation of a Rudimentary Electrocardiogram using Operational Amplifier LM741

This repository contains the design, implementation, and analysis of a rudimentary Electrocardiogram (ECG) circuit built using the LM741 operational amplifier. The project demonstrates the use of analog circuit design techniques to capture and amplify bioelectric signals from the human body.

## Objective
To design a cost-effective ECG circuit that captures and amplifies cardiac signals, serving as an introduction to biomedical instrumentation and analog electronics.

## How It Works
1. **Signal Detection:** Electrodes detect weak electrical signals from the heart.
2. **Amplification:** Signals are amplified using the LM741 operational amplifier and a resistor network.
3. **Visualization:** The amplified signal is processed and displayed using a Python-based visualization tool.

## Components Used
### Analog Components:
- LM741 Operational Amplifier
- Resistors:
  - 1.8 kΩ (voltage divider network)
  - 100 kΩ (feedback resistor)
  - 10 MΩ (weak signal detection)
- 9V Battery
- ECG Pads and Connectors
- TRS Auxiliary Cable
- Solderless Breadboard

### Digital Components:
- Computer (MacBook Pro used in this project)
- PyCharm Professional IDE
- Python Libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `sounddevice`

## Design Process
1. Assemble the circuit on a solderless breadboard using the LM741 and resistor network.
2. Connect the circuit output to a TRS auxiliary cable for signal transmission.
3. Process the signal using a Python script to generate the ECG waveform.

## Features
- Gain: Approx. 56.56 (suitable for basic signal detection).
- Visualizes a 2-second capture of ECG signals.
- Demonstrates the basics of analog signal processing.

## Limitations
- Limited signal gain for raw ECG signals.
- High noise levels due to lack of advanced filtering.
- Non-real-time data capture (only 2 seconds).

## Results
- The circuit successfully captured ECG signals with identifiable peaks (systole phase).
- Noise and low gain affected signal clarity.

## Future Improvements
- Add digital and analog filtering for noise reduction.
- Increase gain using advanced operational amplifiers (e.g., AD620).
- Implement real-time signal acquisition and wireless data transmission.
- Develop a GUI for live ECG visualization.
